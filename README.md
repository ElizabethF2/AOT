A series of scripts for AOT caching which use Cython or Nuitka to either compile a given python script or that will run a cached copy of the compiled script and dynamically recompile the script if the cache is dirty. Enables a small but significant increase in script performance without require any changes to the script in question.

This readme is a stub. Full documentation and a license will be added in the future. See the current comments and code for info regarding setup and usage.
